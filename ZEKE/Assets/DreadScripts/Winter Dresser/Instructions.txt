Version: v1.0.5
WinterDresser is made to dress up your Avatar with Winter's clothes as easily as possible.

Simple How To Use:
------------------
1- Drag and Drop the Clothes and Props prefabs/models onto the Root of the Avatar.
2- Open the tool under WinterPaw > WinterDresser
3- Set your Avatar in the Avatar field at the top.
4- Double check that the field next to the avatar is the appropriate Body mesh. Replace it if not.
5- (VRC) Set the "Expression Menu" field to the menu that you want to add buttons to.
6- Press the "+" button, and Drag and Drop the new models under the root onto the new target fields.
7- (Optional) Set whether these models are On/Off by default by clicking the Red/Green Icon. Green = On. Red = Off.
8- Press "Merge"/"Add" at the bottom to add the target models to the Avatar.

Done! You can use Lyuma's Emulator or build a test for in-game to test if everything is working appropriately.

Info: 
- Upon tool window open or Avatar field replacement. The tool will try its best to automatically detect the settings for steps 3 to 7.
- All assets created will be generated under the "New Assets Path" path.
